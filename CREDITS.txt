Sprites:
- Conveniently taken from Russian Overkill.
- Extra shield graphics by PillowBlaster.

Sounds:
- UI sounds conveniently taken from Bullet-Eye.
- Shield break/restore (The Halo Vaccinator): https://gamebanana.com/sounds/40287
- Flux vent sound by Fractal Softworks (Starsector).

Idea:
- LSWraith
- Fractal Softworks for coming up with the flux idea in the first place. I took it from Starsector.
