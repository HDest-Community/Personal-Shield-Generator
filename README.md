### Notes
---
- The Personal Shield Generator can be found both in the wild and in backpacks.
- Loadout code is `psg`.

### Mechanics
---
- The generator needs at least one battery to function.
- Each battery adds +1000 to max capacity.
- For every 500 shield units recharged, all batteries lose one 1 charge.
- Recharge rate varies depending on shield amount. It peaks at half capacity and goes down as shield depletes or regenerates. Higher overall capacity means higher regeneration cap. 
- Multiple shield generators do not stack due to interference.
