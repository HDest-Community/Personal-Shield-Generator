### Notes
---
- The Personal Shield Generator can be found both in the wild and in backpacks.
- Loadout code is `psg`.

### Mechanics
---
- The generator needs at least one battery to function.
- Each battery increases max capacity.
- Efficiency is how many units of shield need to be recharged for all batteries to lose 1 charge. Each cycle reduces efficiency.
- Recharge rate varies depending on shield amount. It peaks at half capacity and goes down as shield depletes or regenerates.
- Multiple shield generators do not stack due to interference.
